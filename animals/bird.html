            <h2> Gavia Immer </h2>
            <p>
              Is a member of the loon family of birds that is most abundant in Canada and Northern United States. They nest on lakes and large ponds. Most common description of the species is the black head of the breeding adults. As can be understood they are all covered with feather. Additionally they have beak rather than teeths. <br><br>

              They are monogamous and internal fertilization takes place. They breed once per year in the summer at age two or three. In winter they migrate to shallow coastal marine habitat but early in the spring male and  females arrive on the breeding territory together. Development takes place externally. The female lays one or three eggs on a vegetation that is close to water. Both of the parents build up the nest and feed the young. They are visual predators that mainly feed on fish and other aquatic animals.<br><br>

              They are warm blooded animals with four chambered heart. Different from mammals they have air sacs within their bones to compenstae the pressure diffrences. Additionaly they do not have any alveoli wtihin their lungs. Parabronchi take over the alveoli.<br><br>
