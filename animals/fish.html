            <h2> Xiphias Gladius </h2>
            <p>
                A cartilaginous fish Xiphias is also called as the swordfish which are large and highly migratory. They can be also labelled as a predatory fish.  They are found Worldwide in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian  oceans. Main habitats of them are the cold waters at depths between 200- 600 m between 5-27ËšC. <br><br>
                They feed on marine mammals. In contrast they can be eaten by mainly sharks, marlins and sailfishes. They have two chambered heart. Moreover as all the other fishes just deoxygenated blood can pass from their heart towards the gills to become oxygenated.  Therefore for respiration they use gills.<br><br>
                External fertilization takes place in addition to the external development. Females tend to lay down their eggs in warmer waters theough the year rounds and during the spring and summer months in cooler regions. Eggs measure 1.6-1.8mm in diameter and begin devoloping into emryos about 2.5 days after they are fertilized.<br><br>
